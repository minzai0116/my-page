          <p>Pencil is useful when I take notes in class or drawing something.<br>
             Keyboard polio is very expensive(219,000won),but it worth paying and is comfortable for not needed to charge.<br>
             Trackpad is also expensive(169,000won) and I bought it several days ago,so I have to use it more. </p>
